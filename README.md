Hello All,

Hope you are safe and doing good during this global pandemic crisis of COVID-19.
This is a repository for CORONA Dashboard - https://coviddash.wittymoves.com.

I have used my quarantine time to do something productive which will also be useful to the world in this hour of need, especially when we are surrounded by humours on the ground report. Being a Data Scientist and Developer, I have created a global COVID-19 Dashboard (link shared above - https://coviddash.wittymoves.com/) using various Data Science Tools.

It has following features:
1. Global data and trends are available along with Indian data and trends
2. Specialized for India: State specific data available
3. Data for countries not recognized by UN also available
4. Data Visualization using Exponential growth curve available for India
5. Interactive charts and graphics to make sure the insights are interpretable easily 
6. Cruise ship data also available
7. Sources are reliable (includes official government sources)
8. Table Search option available.
9. Page will auto refresh every after 15 minutes (time interval may change in future), and will show updated data.

I hope you all will like it. I'm open to all suggestions and feedback to improve it further. Let me know your views on the same.

If you like my work, please give it a star. Also, if possible support me in running the hosting server.
If you are inspired by my work, or are using it in direct or indirect way, don't forget to add appropriate attributions and mentions for the same. It'll encourage and help me to continue to create more better tools.

Thank you!
